# Factorial

1. In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
   e.g. 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
   
2. Let's write code that calculates and prints the factorial of 10 (10!).

3. Building blocks: variables, loop print, while loop


# Fibonacci Sequence

1. Take a look at the next sequence of numbers:
   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
   Do you recognize a pattern here? What will be the next number? And the one after it?

2. Let's write code that prints the above sequence up until a certain threshold.

3. Building blocks: variables, print, while loop


# Debugging

1. Bugs are found in both nature and computer programs. In order to root them out we follow a process known as debugging.

2. Up until now we have ran our programs from start to, hopefully, a good finish.
   We will now use the debugger to stop at breakpoints, step through lines of code and inspect variables.
   
3. Let's start by stepping through our programs above and then try to tackle the crash.py program.


# Homework

1. Print all the prime numbers up until 30 (or any other arbitrary number).

   Building blocks: variables, print, while loop, nested loops, if, functions (not mandatory)

2. Crack the crack-me.py program :)

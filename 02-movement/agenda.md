# Lesson 2 - Variables

1. In python a variable is like a "box" that can store a value

2. We can read the value from the box, or change it to a new value

3. A variable has a name.

4. In our program the variable is named "x"

---

1. What lines use the variable "x" ?

2. Let's note:
  - In line 3 we "Create" the variable

  - In line 13 we "Read" the value of the variable

  - In line 15 we "Change" the value of the variable

  - Every time we "Change" the value of a variable inside a function, we have to write "global" at the beginning of the function (our line 9)

# Agenda - Hello Processing World

1. Start with the starter.py program

2. What is a function? Where are the functions in the program?

3. When is "setup" called? When is "draw" called?

4. What would happen if we moved "size" call to "draw" ?

5. What would happen if we moved "fill" and "rect" calls to "setup" ?

6. Then why do we need both?

------------------

1. Let's talk about colors :)

2. The "fill" function receives 3 arguments: (100, 0, 0)

3. What happens when you change it to (0, 100, 0) ?

4. What happens when you change it to (0, 0, 100) ?

5. What happens when you change it to (200, 0, 0) ? (0, 200, 0) ? (0, 0, 200) ?

6. Can you mix colors?

7. How would you paint the rectangle "pink" ?

8. "orange" ? "purple" ? "yellow" ? "lightblue" ?

9. Find some other colors you like

---------------------------

1. Let's talk about rectangles :)

2. The "rect" function receives 4 arguments: (x, y, w, h)

3. Can you move the rectangle to the left? 
   
4. To the bottom?

5. Can you make it wider? or narrower?

6. Can you draw another rectangle?

7. Can you draw another rectangle in a different color?

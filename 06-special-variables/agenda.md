# Hello Keyboard

1. Run the program `print_key.py`. Press some keys and take notes to yourself as to what each key prints when we press on it

2. The program uses 2 new special variables: `key_is_pressed` and `key`. Where are they in the code? What does each of them mean?

3. Modify the program to draw a green background when someone pressed the <Space Bar> key

4. Modify the program to draw a red circle when someone presses the <Enter> key


///////

1. Run the program `starter.py` and see it draws a triangle

2. Modify the code so the triangle will move right when a right arrow is pressed

3. Modify the code to support movement in all 4 directions

4. Our triangle plane needs some protection against the aliens. Modify the code to draw a "shield" (a big circle around it) when pressing "Enter"

5. Modify the code and add diagonal movements using the keys: q, w, e, a, s, d, z, x, c

6. Add some astroids! Create circles that move from right to left

7. Make sure your plane can't fly off the screen
